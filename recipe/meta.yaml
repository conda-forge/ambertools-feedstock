  summary: 'AmberTools is a set of programs for biomolecular simulation and analysis'
  description: |
    AmberTools is a set of programs for biomolecular simulation and analysis.
    They are designed to work well with each other, and with the “regular” Amber
    suite of programs. You can perform many simulation tasks with AmberTools,
    and you can do more extensive simulations with the combination of AmberTools
    and Amber itself.
